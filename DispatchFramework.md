## CPU's then and now
code executed by a CPU core is a thread. So your app is going to have many threads.
In the past a processor had one single core which means it can only deal wiht one task at a time.
Time-slicing was introduced so CPU's can run tasks concurrently(at the same time) using context-switching
As processors gained more core, they were capabale of multi-tasking using parallelism
Now, CPU's use hyperthreading (divides CPU clock cycles between different programs to run more than one program at a time)

# Concurrency and Application Design
*Threads have been around for a while. OS X and iOS take an asynchronous design approach to solve the concurrency problem with the following technologies: GCD and Operation Queues.*

### Thread
The developer has to decide how many threads to create and adjust the number dynamically as system conditions change. So creating asynchronous tasks with threads, developers need to create tasks for execution as well as creating and managing threads. That is why OS X and iOS provides technologies to allow you to perform any task asynchronously without having to manage the threads yourself.

**GCD**\
Moves the thread management code down to the system level. All you have to do is define tasks you want to execute and put them in the appropriate dispatch queue. GCD takes care of creating the needed threads and scheduling tasks to run on those threads.

**Operation Queues**\
Are *Objective-C* objects that act very much like dispatch queues. You define the tasks you want to execute and add them to an aperation queue. Which handles scheduling and execution of those tasks.


# Grand Central Dispatch *GCD or Dispatch*

*GCD organizes tasks into specific queues, and later on the tasks on the queues will get executed in a proper and available thread from the pool. The dispatch framework is a very fast and efficient concurrency framework*

## Synchronous and Asynchronous execution
Each work item can be executed either synchronously(serially) or asynchronously(concurrently). 
with synchronous tasks, you'll block the execution queue, but with async tasks, your call will instantly return and the queue can automatically continue the execution of remaing tasks.

###### Synchronous
synchronous work items are called with the sync method. The program waits until the execution finishes before method call returns to continue the remaing tasks. functions with return types are most likely to be synchronous

###### Asynchronous
asynchronous work items are called with the async method. The method returns immediately. completion blocks are most likely to be asynchronous.
With dispatch queues, you can execute your code synchronously or asynchronously. with synchronous execution, the queue waits for the work. With asynchronous, the code returns emmidiately without waiting for the task to be complete.

> On every dispatch queue, tasks will be executed in the same order as you add them to the queue (FIFO) the first task in the line will be executed first but 
> the task completion is not guaranteed. task completion is up to the code complexity. not order.

## Serial Queues
Also known as *private dispatch queues* executes one task at a time in the order that they were added to the queue. The currently executed tasks are run on distinct threads and serial queues are often used to synchronize access to a specific resource.

## Concurrent queues
Also known as *global dispatch queues* execute one or more tasks concurrently. But tasks are still started in order of how they were added. 

## Main Dispatch Queue 
The main dispatch queue is a globally available serial queue that executes tasks on the applicationâ€™s main thread. 

## QoS


## Technologies that use dispatch queues

- **dispatch groups**: A way to monitor a set of block objects for execution.
- **dispatch semaphores**: They're genrally similar to semaphores but are more efficient. 
- **dispatch sources**: It generates notifications in response to specific types of system events. Example is used to monitor events such as process notifications, signals, and descriptor events.

# Operation Queues
*Operation Queues is the cocoa equivalent of a concurrent dispatch queue. And is implemented using the* **NSOperationQueue** *class. Whereas dispatch queues execute tasks in FIFO, operation queues take other factors into account determining the execution of tasks.*

The tasks you submit to an operation queue must be instances of the NSOperation class. The **NSOperation** is an abstract base class. So you must define custom subclasses to perform your tasks.

Operation object generate key-value observing notifications. Although operation queues always execute operations concurrently, you can use dependencies to ensure they are executed serially. 

# Operations
An abstract class that allows to encapsulate unit of work to be executed later in the future time. 
- object oriented

# Networking in Swift

*All network sessions use a background queue to perform network operations. Network requests usually take a long time to complete. If it were to be called on the main thread/queue, all other operations or tasks would have to wait until the network operation completes. Leading the app to become unresponsive.*
*Always call network operations on the background queue by using GCD. Return back to the main queue once recieved results since all interactions and visual displays occur in the main thread.*

## URL, URLRequests, URLSessions, and URLSessionTask

###### URL
> URL class represents a local or remote URI.
```swift
var url = URL(string: "https://apple.com")
```

###### URLRequest
> URLRequest represents a proper request for a URL
```swift
var request = URLRequest(url: url!)
request.httpMethod = "GET"
```

###### URLSession
> URLSession is a class that allows to perform a URLRequest. Most of the time we use a singleton instance called "shared" if we don't need any special configuration. Other than that, we can create URLSessionConfigurations which contain these most common instances: default, ephumeral, and background.
```swift
var session = URLSession.shared
var sessionDefault = URLSession(configuration: .default)

\\ downloading a webpage
var dataTask = session.dataTask(with: url) { data, response, error in
	...
}
dataTask.resume()
```

###### URLSessionTask
> URLSessionTask is a class that performs the actual transfer of data. The most common session task is URLSessionDataTask(retrieves the contents of the url as a Data object) !The URLSession class instantiates the task itself under the hood. Also remember to resume all tasks with the resume() method or the task wont start.
```swift
var url = URL(string: "https://apple.com")
```


# Semaphores
Semaphores acts as the decision maker about what shared resource gets displayed on the thread indicating with the wait() and signal() function. They consist of threads queue and counter value.
- *Threads Queue*: Used by the semaphore to keep track of what has acces to the shared resource first. This is in FIFO order. (First thread entered will be the first to get access to the shared resource once avaiable)
- *Counter Value*: used by the semaphore to decide if a thread should get access to the shared resource or not. This value changes when called *signal()* or *wait()* functions.\
\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call *wait()* before using the shared resource. To ask if the shared resource is available or not. should not be called on the main thread since it will freeze the app.\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call *signal()* after using the resource. Signaling the semaphore that we are done interacting with it.

**Thread safe**: *Code that can be safely called from multiple threads and not cause any issues.*

- Below Is a sample simulation of 2 people using a Switch--shared resource.

```swift
let semaphore = DispatchSemaphore(value: 1)
DispatchQueue.global().async {
    semaphore.wait()
    sleep(1) // Person 1 playing with Switch
    print("Person 1 - done with Switch")
    semaphore.signal()
}
DispatchQueue.global().async {
    semaphore.wait()
    print("Person 2 - wait finished")
    sleep(1) // Person 2 playing with Switch
    print("Person 2 - done with Switch")
    semaphore.signal()
}
```
*Explanation*: declare the semaphore counter value to 1 indicating that we only want the resource to be accessible by one thread. Then we call the ```wait()``` to make sure we can access the resource and execute the task and don't forget to call the ```signal()``` to signal that we are done using the resource.

## Semaphores and GCD
Dispatch groups are used when you have a load of things you want to do that can happen all at once.\
Semaphores are used when you have a resource that can be accessed by N threads at the same time. They are used mainly for multiple tasks that use the same resource.
